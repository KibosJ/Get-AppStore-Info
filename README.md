# Get-AppStore-Info
Get information for an Apple App Store app, including the bundle ID

# How to use the script

The script will ask for the App Store ID which is the number from the URL

Using BBC iPlayer as an example the URL is 

`https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/bbc-iplayer/id416580485`

So the ID would be `416580485`
